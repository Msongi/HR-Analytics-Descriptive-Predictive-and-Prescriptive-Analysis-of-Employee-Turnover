# HR Analytics: Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive Analysis of Employee Turnover
Company X has an attrition problem. Employee turnover is a serious problem for a company, it costs the company approximately 20% of that employee's salary to replace them. Not to mention the time and loss in productivity. Company X's HR department has given some data about their employees both existing employees and those who left. They want to have insights as to why employees are leaving, but most importantly they want a predictive model to say which employees are likely to leave.

### What is employee attrition?

Employee attrition is when an employee leaves the company through any method, including voluntary resignations, layoffs, failure to return from a leave of absence, or even illness or death. Whenever anyone ceases working for the company for any reason and is not replaced for a long time (if ever), that would be employee attrition.

There are two main types of employee attrition:

**Voluntary attrition**: When an employee chooses to leave the company. This can include any reason an employee leaves on their own accord, whether it’s truly voluntary or not. 

**Involuntary attrition**: When the company decides to part ways with an employee, this is involuntary attrition. This can be through a position elimination, for example, due to reorganization or layoffs, for cause (such as stealing or fighting), poor performance, or termination when someone abandons their job. (You can argue the last one is a voluntary termination, but the company makes the final call to terminate.) The company then doesn’t backfill the position or eliminates it.

Involuntary attrition through position elimination is the most common form of attrition, as the company decides proactively to eliminate a position. For other types of termination, the company usually decides after the termination to leave the job vacant.

**Organizational development is a critical process that should be monitored with the right HR metrics**. 

The annual overall turnover rate in the U.S. in 2017 was 26.3%, based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The cost of replacing an individual employee can range from one-half to two times the employee's annual salary -- and that's a conservative estimate.
So, a 100-person organization that provides an average salary of $50,000 could have turnover and replacement costs of approximately $660,000 to $2.6 million per year.

Fifty-two percent of voluntarily exiting employees say their manager or organization could have done something to prevent them from leaving their job. Over half of exiting employees (51%) say that in the three months before they left, neither their manager nor any other leader spoke with them about their job satisfaction or future with the organization.

Evidently Attrition is a bi problem which needs to be solved.

In this project we are going to do 1. Prescriptive Analytics 2. Descriptive Analytics 3. Predictive Analytics to help solve Company X's problem. An extensive Exploratory Data Analysis will be seen in this solution
